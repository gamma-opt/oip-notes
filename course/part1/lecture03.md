# Lecture 3

## What is a function?

- Discuss the formal definition of a function and how it relates to the idea of converting inputs to outputs
- Describe function properties (unique outputs)
- Mention example, and show that they can have multiple shapes, discontinuities

## Function domains

- Describe the notion of for what values it makes sense to evaluate the function
- Define domain formally
- Define subdomains, i.e., subsets of the domain that are of interest
- Discuss open and closed domains

## Analysing a function

- Looking at function values to say something about its shape
- Difference of function values and the notion of derivatives and gradients
- When you can calculate them, the notion of smoothness and continuity
- Using gradients to "feel" how the function behaves locally
- Find points where minimum or maximum function evaluation happen using gradients
