# Mathematical programming models: (mixed-)integer examples

In this lecture, we develop further the notion of modelling problem using integer-valued decision variables. When a model is such that both continuous and integer variables are present, we say that it is a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model.

First, we start by introducing the famous **Travelling Salesperson Problem**, which can be formulated as an integer programming model. Then we expand some of our previous examples from the previous lectures, such that they include additional decisions that can be modelled using integer variables.

## Travelling Salesperson Problem

The travelling salesperson problem (TSP) is one of the most famous combinatorial optimisation problems, perhaps due to its interesting mix of simplicity while being computationally challenging. Assume that we must visit a collection of {math}`n` cities at most once, and return to our initial point, forming a so-called **tour**. When travelling from city {math}`i` to a city {math}`j`, we incur in the cost {math}`C_{ij}`, representing, for example, distance or travel time. Our objective is to minimise the total cost of our tour.
Notice that this is equivalent to finding the minimal cost permutation of {math}`n-1` cities, discarding the city which represents our starting and end point.

```{figure} ../figures/random_graph.svg
:name: random_graph
:align: center

An example collection of cities (or points) for which we would like to find the minimum cost tour for.
```

To pose the problem as an integer programming model, let us define {math}`x_{ij}=1` if city {math}`j` is visited directly after city {math}`i`, and {math}`x_{ij}=0` otherwise.
Let {math}`N=\{1,\dots,n\}` be the set of cities.
We assume that {math}`x_{ii}` is not defined for {math}`i\in N`.
A naive model for the travelling salesperson problem would be

```{math}
:label: tsp_naive
:nowrap:

\begin{align*}
\mini_{x} &\sum_{i\in N}\sum_{j\in N} C_{ij}x_{ij} \\
\st &\sum_{j\in N\setminus\{i\}}x_{ij}=1,~\forall i\in N \\
&\sum_{i\in N\setminus\{j\}} x_{ij}=1,~\forall j\in N \\
&x_{ij}\in\{0,1\},~\forall i,\forall j\in N : i\neq j.
\end{align*}
```

However, this formulation has an issue. Although it can guarantee that all cities are only visited once, it cannot enforce an important feature of the problem which is that the tour cannot present disconnections, i.e., contain **sub-tours**. In other words, the salesperson must physically visit from city to city in the tour, and cannot "teleport" from one city to another.

```{figure} ../figures/tsp_subtours.svg
:name: subtours
:align: center

A feasible solution for the naive TSP model. Notice the two sub-tours formed.
```

In order to prevent sub-tours, we must include constraints that can enforce the full connectivity of the tour. There are mainly two types of such constraints.
The first is called **cut-set constraints** and is defined as

```{math}
\sum_{i\in S}\sum_{j\in N\setminus S} x_{ij}\geq 1,~\forall S\subset N, 2\leq |S|\leq n-1.
```

The cut-set constraints act by guaranteeing that among any subset of nodes {math}`S \subseteq N` there is always at least one arc {math}`(i,j)` connecting one of the nodes in {math}`S` and a node not in {math}`S`.

An alternative type of constraint is called **sub-tour elimination** constraint and is of the form

```{math}
\sum_{i\in S}\sum_{j\in S}x_{ij}\leq |S|-1,~\forall S\subset N,2\leq |S|\leq n-1.
```

Differently from the cut-set constraints, the sub-tour elimination constraints prevent the cardinality of the nodes in each subset from matching the cardinality of arcs within the same subset.

There are some differences between these two constraints and, typically cut-set constraints are preferred for being more effective from a computational standpoint. In any case, either of them suffers from the same problem: the number of such constraints quickly becomes **computationally prohibitive** as the number of nodes increases. This is because one would have to generate a constraint to each possible node subset combination from sizes 2 to $n âˆ’ 1$.

A possible remedy to this consists of relying on **delayed constraint generation**. In this case, one can start from the naive formulation TSP and from the solution, observe whether there are any sub-tours formed. That being the case, only the constraints eliminating the observed sub-tours need to be generated, and the problem can be warm-started. This procedure typically terminates far earlier than having all of the possible cut-set or sub-tour elimination constraints generated.

### Code Example

Let's solve a smaller TSP problem in JuMP.
We can generate an instance of the problem using the following.

```{code-cell}
:tags: [remove-output]
using Random

function generate_distance_matrix(n; random_seed = 1)
    rng = Random.MersenneTwister(random_seed)
    X_coord = 100 * rand(rng, n)
    Y_coord = 100 * rand(rng, n)
    d = [sqrt((X_coord[i] - X_coord[j])^2 + (Y_coord[i] - Y_coord[j])^2) for i in 1:n, j in 1:n]
    return d, X_coord, Y_coord
end
```

We pick $n=200$.
```{code-cell}
:tags: [remove-output]
n = 200
d, X_coord, Y_coord = generate_distance_matrix(n)
```
```{code-cell}
:tags: [remove-input]
using CairoMakie
fig, ax, plot = scatter(X_coord, Y_coord)
fig
```

As a start, we can implement the naive model in {eq}`tsp_naive`.
```{code-cell}
using JuMP, HiGHS
using LinearAlgebra  # for the dot function

function tsp_naive(d, n::Int; silent=false)
    # Create a model 
    m = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer)
    if silent
      set_silent(m)
    end
    
    # x[i,j] = 1 if we travel from city i to city j, 0 otherwise.
    @variable(m, x[1:n,1:n], Bin)
        
    # Minimize length of tour
    @objective(m, Min, dot(d,x))
    
    # Ignore self arcs: set x[i,i] = 0  
    @constraint(m, sar[i = 1:n], x[i,i] == 0)

    # We must enter and leave every city exactly once             
    @constraint(m, ji[i = 1:n], sum(x[j,i] for j = 1:n if j != i) == 1)
    @constraint(m, ij[i = 1:n], sum(x[i,j] for j = 1:n if j != i) == 1)

    
    optimize!(m)
                                
    cost = objective_value(m)         # Optimal cost (length)
    sol_x = round.(Int, value.(x))    # Optimal solution vector
    
    return m, sol_x, cost
end;
```

And use it on our data.
```{code-cell}
m_naive, x_naive, cost_naive = tsp_naive(d, n);
```

The output `x_naive` is a binary matrix indicating the next destination for each city, which we can plot.
```{code-cell}
:tags: [remove-input]

tour_naive = map(argmax, eachrow(x_naive))

for i in 1:n
    lines!(ax, X_coord[[i,tour_naive[i]]], Y_coord[[i,tour_naive[i]]], color = 1, colormap = :tab10, colorrange = (1, 10))
end
fig
```

As expected, this does not look very much like a tour, thus we need to add cut-set constraints.
To do so, we create the following helper function that follows the paths in a given matrix and returns subtours.

```{code-cell}
function get_subtours(x::Matrix{Int}, n::Int)
    subtours = []
    subtour = [1]
    curr = 1
    visited = Set(1)
    queue = collect(1:n)
    while true
        next = argmax(x[curr,:])
        if next in visited  # completed a subtour
            push!(subtour, next)
            push!(subtours, copy(subtour))
            if length(visited) == n
                return subtours
            end
            
            while curr in visited
                curr = pop!(queue)
            end

            # prepare new subtour
            subtour = [curr]
            push!(visited, curr)
        else                # move to new node
            push!(subtour, next)
            push!(visited, next)
            curr = next
        end
    end
end
```

The main optimisation loop is the following, where we iteratively solve the model and generate new cut constraints based on the cycle we observe.

```{code-cell}
:tags: [skip-execution]
(m_naive, x_naive, cost_naive) = tsp_naive(d, n);
lim = 150
set_silent(m_naive)

for it in 1:lim
    
    optimize!(m_naive)

    x = round.(Int, value.(m_naive[:x])) 
    subtours = get_subtours(x, n)
    if length(subtours) == 1 # Found Hamiltonian path
        println("Optimal tour: ", subtours[1]')
        println("Took $(it) iterations to find the optimal solution.")
        break
    end

    println("Iteration $(it); not optimal.")
    println("Subtours:")
    for subtour in subtours
        println(subtour)
        NS = setdiff(1:n, subtour)
        @constraint(m_naive, sum(m_naive[:x][i,j] for i in subtour, j in NS) >= 1)
    end
    print("\n")
end
```

Even though we reach to a solution  for $n=200$ in just 16 iterations, it takes 10 minutes on our computer to actually compute everything.
We can see the evolution of the solution at every iteration.

## Revisiting the food manufacture problem

Recall the  {ref}`p1l5:food` problem. Suppose we want to add some additional conditions on the problem:

- The food produced may never be made up of more than three oils in any month.
- If an oil is used in a month, at least 20 tons must be used.
- If either of VEG 1 or VEG 2 are used in a month, then OIL 3 must also be used.

Conditions of such nature are not uncommon. Often, it is desirable to avoid handling too many ingredients or having them used in too-small amounts. Alternatively, some ingredients may interact with each other in certain ways, for example causing an undesirable chemical reaction, leading to us wanting to impose logical conditions in the model. That said, how can we extend the previous model to take these restrictions into account?

### Solution

All the above conditions depend on whether some oil is used in the blend or not. This is a true/false condition, thus we need integer variables to model it. For that, let

- $d_{ij}$ - takes value 1 if oil $i$ is used in month $j$, and 0 otherwise.

The value of $d_{ij}$ should be linked to that of $u_{ij}$, which represents the amount of use. If $u_{ij}$ is present in the blend (i.e., $u_{ij}>0$), then $d_{ij}$ should be 1. Logically, this can be stated as

```{math}
u_{ij} > 0 \iff d_{ij} = 1,
```

which is equivalent to

```{math}
(u_{ij} > 0 \implies d_{ij} = 1) \land (d_{ij} = 1 \implies u_{ij} > 0).
```

We can model this biconditional using the following constraints

```{math}
u_{ij} &\leq M d_{ij} \\
u_{ij} &\geq \epsilon d_{ij},
```

which is the familiar big-M method and its counterpart, where $\epsilon > 0$ is an arbitrarily small constant. In fact, since we have limits on what nonzero values $u_{ij}$ can take, we can take this a step further. Suppose $i$ is a vegetable oil, so we need it to be at most 200 but at least 20. These conditions can be modelled as 

```{math}
u_{ij} &\leq 200 d_{ij} \\
u_{ij} &\geq 20 d_{ij}.
```

Here, if $d_{ij}=1$, then $u_{ij}$ cannot exceed 200, but need at least 20. If $d_{ij}=0$, then both right-hand sides are zero, which forces $u_{ij}$ to be zero. Repeating this for every oil and month gives us one of the additional conditions we want to impose.

With $d_{ij}$ defined and linked to $u_{ij}$, the other conditions are straightforward to implement. To limit the number of ingredients in a blend to three oils, we can just include the constraint

```{math}
\sum_{i}d_{ij} \leq 3, \forall j \in J.
```

Finally, the last condition can be logically stated as

```{math}
(d_{1j} \lor d_{2j}) \implies d_{5j},
```

which we can rewrite as

```{math}
(d_{1j} + d_{2j} \geq 1) \implies d_{5j} = 1
```

and

```{math}
(d_{1j} + d_{2j} < 1) \lor d_{5j} = 1.
```

In words, the first statement says that if one or both of $d_{1j}$ or $d_{2j}$ are 1, then $d_{5j}$ must be 1. The second statement says that if $d_{1j}$ and $d_{2j}$ are less than 1, i.e., they are 0, the statement is already satisfied and, as such, there is nothing to be stated regarding the value of $d_{5j}$. This can formulated mathematically as follows.

Let us start with the latter case first. On one hand, assuming that $d_{1j}$ or $d_{2j}$ are not 1, we have that the left-hand side is 1. Thus, we do not care about what value $d_{5j}$ would take, other than it can be 0 or 1. Thus, we would end up with a mathematical statement such as

```{math}
0\leq d_{5j}
```

which is trivially satisfied.

In the former case, we may have that the left-hand side takes value 1 or 2, but now $d_{5j}$ can only be 1. For this to fit into the above form, we have to multiply the right-hand side of the constraint by 2, yielding.

```{math}
(1\text{ or } 2) \leq 2d_{5j},
```

which yields the constraint
```{math}
d_{1j} + d_{2j} \leq 2d_{5j}, \forall j \in J.
```

````{note}
Alternatively, one may notice that $(d_{1j} + d_{2j} \geq 1) \implies d_{5j} = 1$ may be stated as 

```{math}
(d_{1j}  \geq 1 \implies d_{5j} = 1) \land (d_{2j} \geq 1 \implies d_{5j} = 1)
```

which can then be represented by the constraints

```{math}
d_{1j} &\leq d_{5j}, \forall j \in J \\ 
d_{2j} &\leq d_{5j}, \forall j \in J.
```

Notice that if we sum the two constraints, we obtain the $d_{1j} + d_{2j} \leq 2d_{5j}, \forall j \in J$. This example illustrates well the fact that seldom there is only one way of modelling problems as mathematical programming models. 
````

With all the additional constraints ready, we can now solve the problem

## Production planning 2

Recall the problem {ref}`p1l5:production`.
Now, instead of the given maintenance schedule, suppose it is up to us to find one that is performed while maximising profits. The following requirements must be observed when devising the maintenance plan:

- Each machine, with exception of the grinders, must be down for maintenance in any one of the six months.
- Only two of the four grinders need to be down in any one of the six months.

### Solution

Now, we need to keep track of how many machines are down for maintenance. As such, we define a new variable

- $d_{kj}$ - number of machines of type $k$ that are down for maintenance in month $j$,

where $k=1,\dots,5$ represents (1) grinders, (2) vertical drills, (3) horizontal drills, (4) borers and (5) planers, respectively.
Of course, $d_{kj}$ are integer variables, and each type $k$ will impose a different upper bound, based on the number of machines available in total.

With these variables defined, we can impose the appropriate number of maintenances with the constraints

```{math}
\sum^6_{j=1}d_{kj} = \begin{cases}2 &\text{ for }i=1,2, \\
3 &\text{ for }i=3, \\
1 &\text{ for }i=4, \\
1 &\text{ for }i=5.
\end{cases}
```

Lastly, we need these variables to actually affect the amount of production possible. We do so by modifying our constraints from before such that the availability of the machine decreases if there is some maintenance going on.
For the case of grinders as an example, before we had

```{math}
0.5m_{11}+0.7m_{21}+0.3m_{51}+0.2m_{61}+0.5m_{71}\leq 1152 \\
0.5m_{12}+0.7m_{22}+0.3m_{52}+0.2m_{62}+0.5m_{72}\leq 1536 \\
0.5m_{13}+0.7m_{23}+0.3m_{53}+0.2m_{63}+0.5m_{73}\leq 1536 \\
0.5m_{14}+0.7m_{24}+0.3m_{54}+0.2m_{64}+0.5m_{74}\leq 1536 \\
0.5m_{15}+0.7m_{25}+0.3m_{55}+0.2m_{65}+0.5m_{75}\leq 1152 \\
0.5m_{16}+0.7m_{26}+0.3m_{56}+0.2m_{66}+0.5m_{76}\leq 1536,
```

indicating that in periods $j=1,5$ there was maintenance planned for the grinders. Now, we have a uniform number of available hours minus the downtime per grinder in maintenance (recall that each grinder works 2 shifts times 8 hours per shift times 24 days ina month, totalling 384 per month). This can be stated as 

```{math}
0.5m_{1j}+0.7m_{2j}+0.3m_{5j}+0.2m_{6j}+0.5m_{7j}\leq 1536 -384 d_{1,j}, \forall j \in \braces{1, \dots, 6}.
```

Naturally, the same must be considered for the remaining machine types. Now we can solve the modified problem

% &nbsp; is non-breaking space
The resulting objective value tells us that we can have profits of â‚¬108&nbsp;855.
How does this compared to the result we obtained with the fixed schedule in {numref}`p1l6:production`?

```{list-table} Maintenance schedules comparison
:name: production_comparison
:header-rows: 1

* -
  - Old schedule
  - New schedule
* - **January**
  - 1 Grinder
  - 1 Horizontal drill
* - **February**
  - 2 Horizontal drills
  - 1 Vertical drill
* - **March**
  - 1 Borer
  - 
* - **April**
  - 1 Vertical drill
  - 2 Grinders, 2 horizontal drills, 1 borer and 1 planer
* - **May**
  - 1 Grinder and 1 Vertical drill
  - 1 Vertical drill
* - **June**
  - 1 Planer and 1 Horizontal drill
  -
* - Profits
  - â‚¬93&nbsp;715
  - â‚¬108&nbsp;855
```

{numref}`production_comparison` presents both maintenance schedules and the associated profits.
We can see that the new schedule yields higher profits, which should not be surprising since it is a relaxation of the problem and thus the objective value can only increase (since we are maximising).
