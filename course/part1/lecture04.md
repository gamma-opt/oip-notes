# Lecture 4

## Optimisation modelling
- Explain how functions can represent real-world interactions between inputs and outputs

## Objective functions
- Illustrate that functions can represent costs, revenue, profit, performance
-  Objective functions are functions with a "mission": maximise or minimise

## Defining constraints
- Show that functions can be also be used to state logical relations of the problem we are modelling
- The relation can be =, >=, or <=
- Show that the generate a set that can be used as a subdomain
