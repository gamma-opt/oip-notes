/* The `quantecon_book_theme` template incorporates a "Download PDF" button that either
 * - prints the page (so that it can be saved as PDF), or
 * - if a `_pdf` path exist in the build process, points to the pdf file in there.
 * 
 * Our current plan is to make the PDF of the entire book available to download,
 * and using this button for that would be somewhat misleading, as one can easily assume 
 * it means download PDF of page.
 * I'm not sure if I can edit the template without forking the theme, so I wrote this.
 * 
 * This script is added to the header of every HTML file.
 * The removePdfButton function has two hardcoded elements:
 * - the toolbar class name, and
 * - the PDF button being the 12th item in that list.
 * 
 * The event listener makes sure the above function is called when the page is loaded.
 * 
 * EDIT: Added the contrast button as well, since dark mode doesn't work well with some elements.
